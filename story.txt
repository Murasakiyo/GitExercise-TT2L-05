Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He takes a bath.
He has breakfast.
Then he cried.
He goes to class.
Nobody was inside.
That was when Adam thought to himself...
"What day is today?"
He walked out in the nude
Bareskin and glistening
No one is around to see him
He felt incredulous in the end
